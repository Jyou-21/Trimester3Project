# Second Milestone

## What was the original goal of your project?

The original goal of this project was to create a temple dash/escape text adventure with randomized traps and encounters in order to add replayability as well as flexibility to the app, allowing for infinite variation implementation once the framework was complete.

## How have the goals of your project changed?

The goals are relatively the same, with some slight alterations.  Limitations in time resulted in the main goal being to just make it to the first 3 traps in a random fashion so it can be runnable.

## What is a significant thing that you learned while building this project?

The significant thing I learned during this is building code with flexibility, AKA code that runs with almost all thedata and variables it is using being unpredicted, and thus I have strengthened my skills in learning to write code that can accept and deal with various data sets and situations.

## Describe an unexpected challenge that came up during this project, and how you overcame it.

An unexpected challenge for me was that logic I prieviously mentioned.  While it is great to practice writing multi situationally applicable code, you have to handle every and any posible varriation.  While a great skill to have, I have wrestled with it quite a bit in this project.

## Knowing what you know now, if you were to rebuild this project completely from scratch, what would you do differently, and why?

If I were to restart this project, I would start with the logic first.  Although the data is useful in testing, you only really need 1 trap to test the logic and how it handles that.  Order of priorities and restructuring how I completed certain elements would have been helpful and sped up the process.  The logic of this app is easily what is giving me the biggest headache, so doing that upfront feels like a necessary decision if I were to restart.
