 ### What is the current goal of your project?
 
 To have the first 3 traps randomized, pulled into a sequence, and playable with multiple choices per trap.  Secondary goals will be to add alternate random traps; more variation will give it more replayability and be more realized.  Each room should be randomized, meaning that you are garenteed a different combination and/or order of traps each time you play.  With implementation of more variations, the app will become more and more varying with each playthrough, but getting the logic foundation that uses the variations is of higher priority.
 
 ### What have you accomplished so far toward that goal?
 
 I have created the file that I will be pulling the information about the traps from using dictionaries within dictionaries, as well as mapped out the structure of the traps as well as the foundation to add a treasure room and an escape, although the first 3 traps being randomized is the top priority.
 
 ### What do we need to know if we want to run your project in its current state? For example, maybe this app can only be run on your phone, not in Simulator. Or maybe there are a couple of bugs that the user needs to avoid for now.
 
 In its current state, it doesn't run.  I havent gotten it to a runable state because of the need for a data set that the logic of the app can pull from, and that I can use to test.  Now that it is out of the way, the logic of it is the main focus, and how it interacts and pulls information, assigns it to labels and buttons, then redirects based on which choice the player makes.  Later on, if I have time I want to look into UI design and see how I could spice up the asthetics as well as give the segues some clean looking transition animations, but that is if I can get the absolute fundementals down.
 
 ### What percentage of your goal would you estimate you have completed? Measure this in time spent working on the project so far and the amount of time you estimate you would need in order to complete the project. So if, for example, you've worked 10 hours on this project and you think it would take 15 more hours to complete it, then you are 40% of the way done.
 
 I beleive I am about 30%-40% done, maybe slightly less because I am anticipating running into some roadblocks with the logic, especially when it comes to segueing based on parameters and differing sets of information eing used
 
 ### What is the most significant achievement you've made so far on this project? This could be something you built (a feature of the app) or the way that you built it (the way your code is written).
 
The part I am currently most proud of is organizing the structure of the information being used; it isn't a lot of code, but getting it into the exact form needed in order to be used concisely and efficiently.  However, I don't think this answer will remain true come completion of the project, because my plans for how it randomly selects and then programatically implements a trap ontop of a basic template built in the storyboard is something I am excited about building
 
 ### What do you anticipate being the hardest part of the remainder of your project?
 
 I anticipate that the prieviously mentioned implementation of randomized yet linear guide rails the user is on will be harder than I anticipate; I personally see it as a roller coaster, but each section is randomized between a loop, drop, turn, squiggle, etc.  It is still linear, but guided.
