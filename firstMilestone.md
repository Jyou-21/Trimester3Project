 ### What is the current goal of your project?
 ### What have you accomplished so far toward that goal?
 ### What do we need to know if we want to run your project in its current state? For example, maybe this app can only be run on your phone, not in Simulator. Or maybe there are a couple of bugs that the user needs to avoid for now.
 ### What percentage of your goal would you estimate you have completed? Measure this in time spent working on the project so far and the amount of time you estimate you would need in order to complete the project. So if, for example, you've worked 10 hours on this project and you think it would take 15 more hours to complete it, then you are 40% of the way done.
 ### What is the most significant achievement you've made so far on this project? This could be something you built (a feature of the app) or the way that you built it (the way your code is written).
 ### What do you anticipate being the hardest part of the remainder of your project?
